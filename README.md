# Banano_RPC_Tester
Uses Nano RPC wrapper on Banano Network!
/// Rowjelio, 6/20/2021
/// most of this code is from Jerzy Stanislawski's DOT NANO project. He is an awesome guy and deserves 80% of the credit!
/// I didnt even change the references of the namespace to make sure he gets most of the kudos here! He's a freakin genius!
/// I did re compile them as .net framework 4.8 and added a windows form project
/// the github for that is https://github.com/JerzyStanislawski/DotNano
/// I also changed certain parts so that it works with BANANO addresses and not NANO addresses.
/// Dont forget to check out the NANO RPC calls to see how you need to do things here
/// https://docs.nano.org/commands/rpc-protocol/

I was using the banano tester node but it's been down, so the screenshots are from my personal node that I built.

I can be found on Banano discord username rowjelio
